Setting up the floating dome test case.

A. Create the land ice input file.
  1. Create the grid file by running periodic hex with the associated namelist.
  2. Make a land ice grid file by running land_ice_projects/grid_tools/add_land_ice_variables_to_mpas_grid.py (which is currently only on the old subversion repo).
  3. Setup the land ice initial conditions by running setup_dome_initial_conditions.py.
  4. Copy the land_ice_grid.nc file and any graph.info.part files into the land_ice dir.
B. Create the ocean grid file.
  1. Create the grid file by running periodic hex or use the file generated by step A.1.
  2. Setup the ocean grid file by running basin.
  3. Run the script for applying the surface pressure defined by the ice present in land_ice_grid.nc
  4. Copy the ocean grid file and any graph.info.part files in the ocean dir.

C. Setup runs by modifying the templates namelist.input.land_ice and namelist.input.ocean in this directory
D. Modify the coupler script if necessary - set the BASEDIR to be this direction.
E. Run the script from any location.
